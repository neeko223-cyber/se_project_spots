### Improvements
Things i wish to improve on is a better understand of the Media Queries. I struggled after the video setup for it to implement the necessary requirements to complete on time for the project. I wish to in the future to study more on this and Improve on the coding for this. I also still struggle with rereading my code to find misspelling errors causing things to not work.
